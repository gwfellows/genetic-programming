very similar to what I am doing:
https://github.com/moshesipper/tiny_gp

evolution:

define terminals
functions
fitness measure
terminatio criteria
parameters (pop size, etc)

raw fitness = sum of fitness for all fitness cases
s(i,t) = r_max-r(i,t) (if larger is originally better)

adjusted
a(i,t) = 1/(i+s(i,t))
0 --> bigger = better

normalized = adjusted / sum(all adjusted fitnesses)

chance of reproduction = normalized fitness

--
gen = 0
get initial pop

while the termination criterion is not satisfied:
	get fitnesses
	while len(new_pop)<M
		select either reproduction or crossover
		if reproduction:
			reproduce
		if crossover:
			cross over
